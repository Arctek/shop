# A shopfront

The project will start as a database whereby:

    as an administrator, you can add products, which consist of an id, a price and a stock.
    as a regular user you can buy 1 of the products.
    as the owner you can make payments or withdraw value from the contract.

Eventually, you will refactor it to include:

    ability to remove products.
    co-purchase by different people.
    add merchants akin to what Amazon has become.
    add the ability to pay with a third-party token.

Portability

Make your HTML and Javascript portable so that it works:

    in a regular browser, with a local Geth
    in Mist
    with Metamask and a public Geth
